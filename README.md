# Cloud-Project-Codebase
Cloud Computing 
A serverless application that generates professional emails using Amazon Bedrock's foundation models. This project demonstrates how to leverage generative AI for business communication automation.
Overview
The Professional Email Generator helps users create well-structured, contextually appropriate business emails based on minimal input. It uses AWS Bedrock's Deep Seek R1 and Titan Text G1 Lite models to generate professionally formatted emails with appropriate tone and content based on user specifications.
Key Features

Contextual Email Generation: Creates complete professional emails based on simple prompts
Tone Customization: Adapts email style based on requested tone (formal, friendly, assertive, etc.)
Serverless Architecture: Fully serverless implementation using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
Persistent Storage: Saves generated emails to S3 for future reference
Responsible AI: Implements bias detection and mitigation strategies

Architecture
Show Image
The application uses a serverless architecture with the following components:

Front-end: Collects user inputs (HTML/CSS/JS)
API Gateway: Handles HTTP requests/responses
Lambda Function: Processes requests and calls Bedrock API
Amazon Bedrock: Provides foundation models for text generation
S3 Bucket: Stores generated emails and metadata

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

AWS Account with access to Amazon Bedrock
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
Python 3.9+
Node.js 14+ (for frontend development)

AWS Configuration

Enable Amazon Bedrock:
bash# Request model access for required models
aws bedrock-agent request-model-access --model-ids deep-seek.r1-lite amazon.titan-text-lite-v1

Create S3 Bucket:
bashaws s3 mb s3://email-generator-<your-unique-id>

Create IAM Role:
See iam/email_generator_policy.json and iam/trust_policy.json for required policies.

Deploy Backend

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Package Lambda function:
bashcd lambda
zip -r ../email_generator_function.zip .

Deploy Lambda:
bashaws lambda create-function \
  --function-name EmailGeneratorFunction \
  --runtime python3.9 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/EmailGeneratorRole \
  --handler app.lambda_handler \
  --timeout 30 \
  --zip-file fileb://email_generator_function.zip

Configure API Gateway:
See api-gateway/openapi-spec.yaml for API specification.

Usage
API Endpoint
Send a POST request to the API endpoint with the following JSON structure:
json{
  "purpose": "Proposing a business partnership",
  "recipient": "CEO of a technology company",
  "key_points": "Our companies have complementary products, suggest an initial meeting to discuss collaboration, highlight potential market benefits of partnership",
  "tone": "professional but enthusiastic"
}
Sample Response
json{
  "email": {
    "subject": "Exploring Mutually Beneficial Partnership Opportunities",
    "body": "Dear [Recipient Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to propose a potential business partnership between our companies that I believe could yield significant benefits for both organizations...",
    "metadata": {
      "model_used": "Deep Seek R1",
      "generation_time": "2025-05-18T14:35:21Z",
      "reference_id": "eb4c7d8a-9e23-4f5a-bc76-9d8b2e7143a2"
    }
  }
}
Frontend Integration
The frontend/ directory contains a simple web interface that can be deployed to S3 or any web hosting service.

Prompt Engineering
The application uses carefully designed prompts to generate high-quality emails. The base prompt template is:
You are a professional email assistant. Draft a professional email with the following details:

Purpose: {purpose}
Recipient: {recipient}
Key points: {key_points}
Tone: {tone}

Format the email with an appropriate subject line, greeting, body, and closing.
Evaluation & Responsible AI
The project includes evaluation metrics and responsible AI considerations:
Evaluation Criteria

Content Relevance
Professionalism
Tone Consistency
Completeness
Format Correctness

Responsible AI Measures

Bias detection in generated content
Privacy protection for user inputs
Cultural sensitivity considerations
Content moderation and filtering

Performance Optimization
To optimize model performance and reduce latency:

Caching: Implement response caching for similar requests
Parameter Optimization: Fine-tuned model parameters for email generation
Parallel Processing: Process multiple requests simultaneously when possible
